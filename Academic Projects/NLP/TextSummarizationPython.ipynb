        "# Problem Statement:- Text Summarization\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Processing language is the Machine learning Model we have to work on to train our model that can actually summarize the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is the process of creating a summary of a certain document which contains the most important information of the original, the purpose of which is to obtain a summary of the main points of the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general there are two types of summarization, abstractive and extractive summarization.\n",
        "- Abstractive Summarization:\n",
        "  - Heuristic techniques are used in abstractive summarization to teach the system to try to grasp the entire context and provide a summary based on that understanding. Summaries are produced in a more human-like manner in this manner, and they are more useful than extractive alternatives.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- Extractive Summarization:\n",
        "  - In essence, extractive summarization entails selecting certain text fragments (often sentences) based on specified weights assigned to the key words, with the choice of text being determined by the weights of the words inside it. The default weights are typically assigned based on how frequently a word appears. Here, the maximum and minimum number of sentences that should be included in the summary can be set in order to control its length.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the given article the text summarization is based on the frequency of the text in an article. If we take a large dataset which may have different essence to the topics, the given model will not be able to capture the essence of the topic and summarize it only by using frequency of the words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goal\n",
        "The main objective of the problem is to understand different approaches of text summarization methods in NLP using python.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have used deep learning - resource intensive method and pretrained transformer model using hugginface.\n",
        "To test how the training data and pretrained data concludes the summary we have deployed Transformer model and hugging face model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Importance \n",
        "\n",
        "The amount of data that is being created digitally is enormous, so it is essential to create a special method for quickly summarising lengthy texts while retaining the core idea. Additionally, text summary enables users to read faster, find information more quickly, and get as much data as feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic objective of text summarization using machine learning is to condense the reference material while maintaining its knowledge and meaning. Examples of multiple text summary descriptions given include one that described the report as text produced from one or more papers that express pertinent knowledge in the first text, which is typically considerably shorter than this and is no longer than half of the main text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore with the help of any text summarization ML model we will save huge amount of time to extract important information from any large text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Project Information\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps taken are as follows to create a text summarization model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data - preprocess\n",
        "2. Tokenizing text into numerical tokens\n",
        "3. Obtain maxlen for the numeric tokens\n",
        "4. Padding/Truncating sequences for identical sequences lengths.\n",
        "5. Creating dataset pipeline.\n",
        "6. Positional Encoding.\n",
        "7. Masking -\n",
        "  - pad-sequences\n",
        "  - Lookahead mask to prevent words from the future from influencing words from the present when one is paying attention to oneself\n",

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.\n",
        "The term \"artificial intelligence\" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display \"human\" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem-solving\". This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.\n",
        "AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.\n",
        "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.\n",
        "The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques—including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n",
        "The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.\n",
